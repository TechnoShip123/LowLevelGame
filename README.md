# LowLevelGame

## About

An opportunity to do more with C++ by creating a game with SDL2.

I had fun writing the Makefile :)

## Dev Environment

> **Note**
> 
> Make sure to first setup the project with the `make setup` command.

### MacOS 

#### M1 / Apple Silicon

- `brew install sdl2 sdl2_image` — Install libraries with brew.
- That's it! The [`Makefile`](./Makefile) is intended for M1 users, so it uses the `/opt/homebrew` path.

#### Intel
