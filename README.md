# LowLevelGame

## About

An opportunity to do more with C++ by creating a game with SDL2. I just love coding at a low level XD 

(I have not yet experienced the p̷̜͈̞̻̪͑̀̓͋͝ã̸͓̯̗̲̮͒i̸̥̣̮̠̔̓̀̓͗ṅ̷͙̗̮̹ of writing a physics engine from scratch)

## Dev Environment

> **Note**
> 
> Make sure to first setup the project with the `make setup` command.

### MacOS 

#### M1 / Apple Silicon

- `brew install sdl2 sdl2_image` — Install libraries with brew.
- That's it! The [`Makefile`](./Makefile) is intended for M1 users, so it uses the `/opt/homebrew` path.

#### Intel

Coming Soon™️, will need to change homebrew path to `/usr/include` and etc.

### Windows

Coming Soon™️

### Linux

Coming Soon™️

## Having Issues?

~~Sounds like a skill issue to me :)~~ Have fun debugging!
